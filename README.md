# Quiz Project

## Descriptiion

The short quiz is intended to test your knowledge on Looney Toons Cartoons.  It is just for fun so that I may try out some of the JavaScript tough during class and includes attempts at: declaration of global variables, object variables with several parameters for thequestions, functions with if else. I am also inclued variables with HTML block. functions for the time (which I don't believe I understand very well) and for loops. Enjoy. 

## Installation

No installation is needed other than prefered browers and a keyboard to enter criteria.

## Usage

The coding on this application would be helpful (once all issue are fixed) with testing for verification that students understand material tough or to test job skills.
